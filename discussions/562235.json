This enables your application to display a list of items (and subitems if the View property is set to View.Details) </h2>\nSo far individual row and all values in each row is identified. Only checkbox is not recognized by UI verify.\r<br />\n<br />\nHas anybody else experience similar behavior? and if so is there any fix for this?\r<br />\n<br />\nMuch appreciated for all the help.\r<br />\nRegards \r<br />\nHari Hara<br />\n",
