We had a couple of XP and 2003 machines here that wouldn't\r\n run the tool, but after doing a Windows Update and ensuring that .Net 3.5 was installed, it resolved the issue.</p>\r\n<p>I haven't spent time trying to confirm the specific package, as for the machines we were having trouble with, I ended up just pulling all critical Windows Updates. I had tried doing it step by step to see if I could find which one, but after messing with\r\n .Net 4.0, and .Net 2.0 frameworks, and a variety of VC++ runtimes, I ended up giving up, and just pulling all updates. Didn't have the time to trace the specific dependency.</p>\r\n",
