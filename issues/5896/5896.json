    "Description": "Thanks for your interests in UI Automation Verify tool!\n \nThere are two toolbar buttons for running test against selected Automation Element node. The second button was meant to provide an option to run test against the selection and all children, however the implementation was pulled just before we published the initial release. We want to pull back the feature to work eventually, but so far the button is not operable. We may remove the button temporary in future updates.\n \nBy writing test driver, you can still run any test against all or any portion of your Automation Element tree.",
