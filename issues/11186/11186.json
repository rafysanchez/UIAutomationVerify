    "Description": "the line\n            return string.Format(\"[{0}:{1}:{2}:{3}]\",DateTime.Now.Hour.ToString(\"00\"), DateTime.Now.Minute.ToString(\"00\"), DateTime.Now.Second.ToString(\"00\"), DateTime.Now.Millisecond.ToString(\"00\").Substring(0, 2));\nhas the following problems:\na) DateTime.Now might change part way through, resulting in say 11:59:59:99 being displayed as 11:00:00:00, as 11:59:59:99 becoming 12:00:00:00 after 11 has been calced. if order is right to left then 11:59:59:99 might be displayed as 12:59:59:99.\nb) Milliseconds of 10 displays as \"10\", 98 displays as \"98\", 100 as \"10\" and 980 as \"98\". some of these are incorrect.\nThese problems can be fixed by using a more compact line of\n            return DateTime.Now.ToString(\"HH:mm:ss:ff\");",
